# VertX-Bookmarks
This project was created as a place to learn ([Vert.x](http://vertx.io/)), an event driven and non blocking framework for creating reactive applications. Vert.x runs on the JVM and its architecture and approach are based on the Reactor pattern, similar to Node.js.

If you are wondering about Vert.x, there is a good writeup in ([JavaWorld](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2078838/mobile-java/open-source-java-projects-vert-x.html)), though it covers version 2.

This version is built using Java 8 and Maven, but Vert.x can support various JVM languages

The ([Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)) defines reactive applications as "systems that are Responsive, Resilient, Elastic and Message Driven."

This project builds the Bookmarks REST services found in chapter 1 of the Pragmatic Programmers book *Seven Web Frameworks in Seven Weeks*. The original services in the book were built using Sinatra and Ruby. 

It also relied on the Vert.x Core Manual and the Intro series
